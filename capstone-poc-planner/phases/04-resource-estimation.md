# Phase 4 — Resource estimation

## Purpose

Estimate what the POC will take, in concrete numbers the student can plan against. "Some hours" and "a bit of compute" are not estimates.

## Preconditions

- Phase 3 complete: PMF assessed, idea finalized for planning purposes.

## Process

Produce concrete estimates across five dimensions. Present them in a table the student can react to.

### 1. Time

Break the build into rough phases and estimate hours for a competent student (someone who has finished this cohort). Use this template, adjusting phases to the project type:

| Phase | Hours (low) | Hours (high) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data / retrieval setup | ... | ... | ... |
| Core agent / logic | ... | ... | ... |
| Eval harness | ... | ... | ... |
| UI | ... | ... | ... |
| Polish + bug-fixing | ... | ... | typically 20–30% of build time |

Be realistic. Capstones usually take 1.5–3x the initial estimate. Note this to the student.

### 2. Compute

Be specific about the bottleneck:

- **Laptop sufficient?** Most RAG and prompting projects are laptop-friendly for POC.
- **Single cloud GPU occasionally?** Fine-tuning, embedding generation at scale, or running a 7B+ local model.
- **Persistent GPU access?** Anything requiring continuous training or serving a local model behind a UI.
- **Specific instance recommendations** if relevant: e.g., "RunPod A40 (~$0.40/hr) for LoRA fine-tuning of a 7B model" or "Modal serverless GPUs for occasional inference."

### 3. API costs

Pull from the official pricing pages cited in Phase 2. Estimate two numbers:

- **Development cost**: rough $ for a student building and testing iteratively for 2–4 weeks. Include eval runs.
- **Demo cost**: rough $ for running through 10–50 demo interactions during presentation / submission.

Sample calculation format:
```
Dev cost estimate:
- ~500 dev iterations × ~3K tokens in + ~1K out per call at $X/Mtok in, $Y/Mtok out
- ~200 eval runs × ~5K tokens per run
- Estimated total: $A–$B
```

Be honest if the cost is high enough to be a real constraint. A POC that costs $200 in API to develop is fine; one that costs $2,000 should be flagged.

### 4. Data

This is the most commonly under-estimated cost in capstones. Cover:

- **What data does the POC need?** Documents, conversations, code, images, ratings, etc.
- **Where does it come from?** Public dataset, scraping, synthesis via LLM, manual creation, the student's own work?
- **How much is enough for a POC?** Be concrete: "100 documents covering 5 categories" or "500 synthetic Q&A pairs" or "a dataset of ~2000 examples for fine-tuning."
- **Licensing concerns?** Especially for scraping or using proprietary content.
- **Will the data be ready before building can start, or is data preparation part of week 1?**

### 5. External services

List what needs to be set up and any free-tier coverage:

- **Vector DB**: Qdrant Cloud free tier, Pinecone starter, Weaviate Cloud free, or self-hosted
- **Observability**: Langfuse (open source, self-host or cloud free tier), Phoenix, custom logging
- **Hosting**: Modal free credits, Vercel hobby, Render free, Hugging Face Spaces
- **Auth / database**: Supabase free tier, Neon free tier, etc.
- **Any paid service that's hard to avoid?** Flag it.

### Sanity check at the end

After presenting all five, ask: "Does this match what you were expecting? Anything here that changes whether this is feasible for you?"

If the resource estimate reveals the project is too expensive, too data-hungry, or too compute-intensive for the student's situation, **say so directly and suggest scope cuts**. Better to find this now than after they've started.

## Output contract

Before moving to Phase 5:

- [ ] Time estimate broken into phases with low/high hours
- [ ] Compute requirements stated specifically (laptop / GPU-occasional / GPU-persistent)
- [ ] API cost estimate for dev + demo with the calculation shown
- [ ] Data needs specified including source and quantity
- [ ] External services listed with free-tier coverage noted
- [ ] Student has confirmed the estimate is feasible, or has agreed to scope cuts to make it feasible

## Project-type notes

- **RAG-heavy**: embedding generation cost is often forgotten. Calculate it: # documents × avg tokens per doc × $/Mtok of embedding model. For 1000 docs × 5K tokens × $0.10/Mtok, that's $0.50 — usually negligible, but for 100K docs it adds up. Also factor in reranker cost if using one.

- **Agentic**: tool-call iteration cost. Agents often loop, and each loop is a full LLM call. A 5-step agent at 4K tokens per call burns 20K+ tokens per task. At demo scale of 50 demos, that's 1M tokens. Math it out.

- **Fine-tuning**: training cost is often the headline number. LoRA on a 7B model can be done in a few hours on a single A40-class GPU; full fine-tunes are dramatically more. Also note hyperparameter sweeps — students often forget they need to run multiple training jobs.

- **Multimodal**: image / audio token costs are often higher than text. Vision input can be 1000+ tokens per image. Calculate explicitly.

- **Inference/systems**: the "cost" here is often compute time on the dev machine rather than API spend. But quantify: hours of benchmarking, how many model variants need to be tested, etc.
