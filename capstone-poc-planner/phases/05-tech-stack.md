# Phase 5 — Tech stack

## Purpose

Pick a stack that matches the project and the student. Students have different exposure (deep LangGraph experience vs none; comfortable with raw API vs needing scaffolding), so ask preferences first, then recommend.

## Preconditions

- Phase 4 complete: resource estimate accepted by the student.

## Process

### Ask the student their preferences

Present these dimensions as questions, not as a fait accompli. The student should weigh in on each before you recommend anything.

**1. Model provider preference?**
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT)
- Google (Gemini)
- Open-weight via API (Llama / Qwen / Mistral via Together, Groq, Fireworks)
- Open-weight self-hosted (Ollama, vLLM)
- Mixed (specify which model for which step)

Ask if they have credits / access constraints — students often have free credits with one provider that should bias the choice.

**2. Agent / orchestration framework preference?** (only ask if project is agentic or has multi-step LLM logic)
- None — raw API calls
- LangGraph
- LlamaIndex (workflows or agent abstractions)
- OpenAI Agents SDK
- CrewAI
- Custom thin layer
- Other

Note their experience level with each — if they've never used LangGraph but it's their first instinct, ask why.

**3. Retrieval stack?** (only ask if RAG is involved)
- Vector DB choice: Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector, Chroma, in-memory FAISS
- Embedding model: OpenAI text-embedding-3, Cohere embed v3, BGE, Voyage, open-weight
- Reranker (or none): Cohere Rerank, BGE reranker, Voyage, cross-encoder
- Hybrid search (BM25 + vector) or pure vector
- Index structure preferences if any

**4. Orchestration / hosting?**
- Local only (Streamlit / CLI on laptop)
- Modal (serverless, GPU-friendly)
- Vercel / Render / Railway (web hosting)
- Hugging Face Spaces
- Self-hosted Docker / Kubernetes
- Whatever's easiest for demo

**5. Frontend?**
- Streamlit (fastest to ship)
- Gradio (good for ML demos)
- Next.js / React (production-feel but more work)
- CLI only
- API only (no frontend)

**6. Observability / logging?**
- Langfuse (open source, popular in this cohort's stack)
- Arize Phoenix
- LangSmith (if using LangChain ecosystem)
- Custom logging
- None for POC (acceptable but flag for production)

### Then recommend

Once the student has shared preferences, recommend a final stack with **reasoning for each choice**. Format:

```
Recommended stack:

- Model: [choice] — because [reason tied to the project's needs, not just "it's good"]
- Framework: [choice or "raw API"] — because [...]
- Retrieval (if applicable): [choice] — because [...]
- Storage: [choice] — because [...]
- Hosting: [choice] — because [...]
- Frontend: [choice] — because [...]
- Observability: [choice] — because [...]
```

### Push back when warranted

If the student's preferences would lead to a bad outcome, **say so directly**. Examples:

- "You said you want to fine-tune a 7B model for sentiment classification, but the project description suggests this is a 5-class problem on short text — a prompted frontier model would beat the fine-tune for a fraction of the engineering cost. Want me to recommend a prompting approach instead?"

- "You're suggesting LangGraph for what's essentially a single LLM call + one tool. The framework overhead is more code than the actual logic. Raw API calls would be 30 lines instead of 200. Reconsider?"

- "You're picking Pinecone, but your dataset is 500 documents. pgvector or in-memory FAISS would be free and faster to set up. Pinecone is overkill at this scale."

Make the recommendation in one round. If the student pushes back with a real reason ("I want to learn Pinecone for my resume"), accept it and document the reasoning in the spec — that's a legitimate constraint.

## Output contract

Before moving to Phase 6:

- [ ] Student has shared preferences (or stated "no preference, recommend") on every applicable dimension
- [ ] You've recommended a final stack with reasoning per choice
- [ ] Any pushback you had on the student's preferences was raised and resolved one way or another
- [ ] Final stack is documented for use in Phase 7 spec section 7

## Project-type notes

- **RAG-heavy**: spend the most time on retrieval stack questions. The student should be able to articulate *why* they're picking dense vs hybrid, which embedding model and why, and whether reranking is justified at their scale. If they can't, that's a teaching moment.

- **Agentic**: the framework choice matters most. Push hard against framework choice that doesn't match the agent's complexity. A 3-tool agent doesn't need LangGraph; a 15-tool multi-agent system probably does. Also ask about MCP — if the agent talks to external services, MCP is often the right choice over custom integrations.

- **Fine-tuning**: stack questions shift to training framework (Hugging Face Trainer, axolotl, Unsloth, MLX-LM if on Mac), where training runs (Colab, Modal, RunPod, local), and serving format (GGUF, AWQ, raw HF, vLLM). Ask explicitly.

- **Multimodal**: model choice is the dominant question. Open multimodal models (Qwen-VL, Llava, Pixtral) vs frontier APIs (Claude with vision, GPT-4o, Gemini). Trade-offs are very different from text-only.

- **Inference/systems**: stack questions are mostly about serving framework (vLLM, TGI, MLX, llama.cpp), benchmarking harness, and quantization tooling. Ask about target hardware specifically.
